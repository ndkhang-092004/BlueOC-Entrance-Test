# React + Vite

Some detail of my project:

First I use Vite React App then install Redux & Redux Tool Kit, I decided to use axios for API calls, then manage state by Redux.
I also add some style by Tailwind!

1. Use Redux & Redux Toolkit to manage state and API calls: All setup in postSlice.
2. PostList to display all posts that get from state managed by Redux
3. PostItem to display each post from data
4. PostForm to create new post
